    <p>or photographs that meet certain quality standards (which are mostly technical in nature)
      and are valuable for Wikimedia projects. Unlike featured pictures, quality images must be the work of Commons contributors;
      they need not be extraordinary or outstanding, but merely well-composed and generally well-executed.
      There are currently 233,306 images marked as Quality images, which is roughly 0.398% of the available images (58,589,207).
      This page highlights recently promoted images that meet the quality image guidelines.
      If you think that a particular image meets the criteria,
      you may nominate it at Commons:Quality images candidates.
      All Quality images can be found in a category called Quality images. You can browse Quality images by country.
